    <p>
      Paint jobs can provide an array of benefits to a building. They can immediately improve the appearance and the
      value of the property. A paint job is certain to wear down over time, which means that it will ultimately have to
      be redone. Knowing the signs that you need a new paint job can ensure that you are able to optimize the appearance
      of your property. This can help to provide superior curb appeal, along with many other benefits. Here are 10 signs
      to help you determine when it is time to get a fresh coat of paint.

          <p class="opacity-75 ml-6">
            Wood can often rot over time, which can result in serious problems with the structure and condition of the
            property. When wood is soft to the touch, it is likely that the wood is beginning to rot. When you notice
            that wood is rotting on your property, it can be an incredibly beneficial step to obtain a new paint job for
            your property. This can help to locate possible rotting wood and prevent any damage to it from escalating. A
            new paint job can go a long way toward protecting the overall condition of the property.

          <p class="opacity-75 ml-6">
            Caulking is commonly found around doorways and the edges of windows. It is used to ensure that these areas
            are well-insulated and can keep energy in and inclement weather out. When the caulking in these areas
            hardens or begins to peel, it is unlikely to be performing its job correctly. Not only can this result in
            energy loss, but it can also allow moisture to seep into the area. When this happens, other problems can
            escalate, including rotting of wood and other issues. Resealing these areas often requires implementing a
            new paint job.

          <p class="opacity-75 ml-6">
            Metal surfaces are more common in industrial buildings, such as warehouses. However, it can still be useful
            to know signs that these types of walls need to be repainted. If the wall begins to show signs of rusting,
            it can be useful to implement a new paint job to protect the surfaces.

          <h2 class="mb-3 text-lg">4. Dirty Appearance</h2>
          <p class="opacity-75 ml-6">
            Does your building still look dirty even after you have given it a good scrubbing? An old paint job will
            inevitably look worn-down over time. When this happens, no amount of scrubbing will make it look clean. The
            best way to resolve a dirty appearance that canâ€™t be resolved with cleaning is by adding a new coat of paint
            to the building. A new coat of paint will help your building to appear newer and cleaner.

          <h2 class="mb-3 text-lg">5. Chalky Residue</h2>
          <p class="opacity-75 ml-6">
            Paint that is beginning to deteriorate will leave behind a chalky residue. You can determine the presence of
            this residue by swiping a finger along the surface of the paint. When the paint begins to deteriorate, it
            will only continue to do so. At this point, obtaining a new paint job can go a long way toward protecting
            your building and restoring it to optimal condition. If you notice a residue being left behind by your
            existing paint job, it is time to procure a new one for your building.

          <p class="opacity-75 ml-6">
            When you are about to sell your building, it is extremely important to take multiple steps to ensure that
            the building is in the best condition possible. First impressions are extremely important, especially when
            it comes to selling your home. A new paint job can help to ensure that the building puts its best face
            forward for possible buyers.

          <h2 class="mb-3 text-lg">7. Flaking</h2>
          <p class="opacity-75 ml-6">
            Flaking, cracking, and the formation of bubbles underneath the surface of the paint is a sure sign that its
            time to invest in a new paint job for your building. Not only can these signs significantly detract from the
            appearance of any room, but it can also leave a mess when paint chips land on the floor. Whenever you notice
            these signs, it is extremely important to add a new layer of paint to the surfaces of your building in order
            to protect them effectively. These issues are often caused by humidity seeping under the surface of the
            paint, though they can also be caused by frequent or extreme exposure to UV rays from the sun.

        <li class="mb-16">
          <h2 class="mb-3 text-lg">8. Fading</h2>
          <p class="opacity-75 ml-6">
            Fading is a common issue that occurs when paint grows older and begins to deteriorate. This is often caused
            when specific areas are frequently exposed to UV rays. This causes the paint to wear out and take on a
            faded, dim appearance. UV rays can also cause fading in other fixtures, such as carpeting or furniture.
            Implementing specific window treatments can go a long way toward eliminating these issues in a room.
            However, once fading has already occurred, a new paint job will be necessary to restore the room to its
            former condition and optimal appearance.

          <h2 class="mb-3 text-lg">9. Discoloration</h2>
          <p class="opacity-75 ml-6">
            You choose a specific color of paint because it appeals to you. However, discoloration can occur over time.
            Discoloration becomes particularly noticeable when it results in an inconsistent hue of color over the area.
            When a paint job begins to look discolored, it will no longer be providing the appearance that you
            originally desired. At this point, a new paint job is often required and can go a long way toward improving
            the appearance of the building and specific room. A newer paint job brings more consistency to the
            appearance, as well.
